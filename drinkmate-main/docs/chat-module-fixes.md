# Chat Module Timeout Fixes

## Problem Identified
The chat deletion functionality was experiencing timeouts due to missing socket event handlers and improper timeout management.

## Root Causes
1. **Missing Socket Event Handler**: The frontend was emitting `chat_deleted` events but the socket service had no handler for this event
2. **Long Timeout Duration**: 30-second timeout was too long and provided poor user experience
3. **No Real-time Updates**: Chat deletions weren't being broadcast to other connected clients
4. **Improper Timeout Management**: Timeouts weren't being cleared properly on success

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Backend Socket Service (`server/Services/socket-service.js`)
- **Added `chat_deleted` event handler** to process deletion events from frontend
- **Broadcasts to all admin sockets** when a chat is deleted
- **Notifies chat room participants** about deletion
- **Proper error handling** for socket events

```javascript
// Handle chat_deleted event (broadcast to all admins)
socket.on('chat_deleted', (data) => {
  try {
    const { chatId } = data;
    
    if (!socket.user.isAdmin) {
      socket.emit('error', { message: 'Admin access required' });
      return;
    }

    console.log(`ðŸ”¥ Chat deleted event received for chat ${chatId}`);

    // Broadcast to all admin sockets that a chat was deleted
    this.adminSockets.forEach(socketId => {
      this.io.to(socketId).emit('chat_list_updated', {
        chat: { _id: chatId },
        action: 'deleted'
      });
    });

    // Also broadcast to the specific chat room to notify any connected users
    this.io.to(`chat_${chatId}`).emit('chat_deleted', {
      chatId: chatId,
      message: 'This chat has been deleted'
    });

    console.log(`ðŸ”¥ Chat deleted event broadcasted for chat ${chatId}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error handling chat_deleted event:', error);
    socket.emit('error', { message: 'Failed to handle chat deletion' });
  }
});
```

### 2. Backend Chat Controller (`server/Controller/chat-controller.js`)
- **Added socket event emission** when chat is deleted via API
- **Broadcasts to all connected clients** for real-time updates
- **Proper error handling** for socket operations

```javascript
// Emit socket event for real-time updates
try {
  const io = req.app.get('io');
  if (io) {
    // Broadcast to all admin sockets that a chat was deleted
    io.emit('chat_list_updated', {
      chat: { _id: chatId },
      action: 'deleted'
    });
    
    // Also broadcast to the specific chat room to notify any connected users
    io.to(`chat_${chatId}`).emit('chat_deleted', {
      chatId: chatId,
      message: 'This chat has been deleted'
    });
    
    console.log('ðŸ”¥ Chat deletion socket events emitted for chat:', chatId);
  }
} catch (socketError) {
  console.error('Error emitting socket events for chat deletion:', socketError);
  // Don't fail the deletion if socket emission fails
}
```

### 3. Server Configuration (`server/server.js`)
- **Made socket.io instance available** to routes via `app.set('io', io)`
- **Enables controllers to emit socket events**

### 4. Frontend Chat Management (`drinkmate-main/app/admin/chat-management/page.tsx`)
- **Reduced timeout from 30 seconds to 10 seconds** for better UX
- **Added proper timeout clearing** on success
- **Improved error handling** and user feedback
- **Better token validation** before making requests

```javascript
// Set a timeout to prevent infinite deleting state (10 seconds)
const deletionTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('ðŸ”¥ Deletion timeout reached, clearing deleting state')
  setDeletingConversation(null)
  toast.error('Deletion timed out. Please try again.')
}, 10000)

// Clear timeout immediately on success
if (response.ok) {
  clearTimeout(deletionTimeout)
  // ... rest of success handling
}
```

### 5. Frontend Chat Dashboard (`drinkmate-main/components/chat/AdminChatDashboard.tsx`)
- **Added `chat_deleted` event listener** for real-time updates
- **Proper cleanup** of event listeners
- **Better user feedback** with toast notifications

```javascript
const handleChatDeleted = (data: { chatId: string, message: string }) => {
  console.log('ðŸ”¥ Chat deleted event received:', data)
  setChats(prev => prev.filter(chat => chat._id !== data.chatId))
  if (activeChat && activeChat._id === data.chatId) {
    setActiveChat(null)
    setMessages([])
  }
  toast.info(data.message || 'Chat has been deleted')
}

// Add event listener
socket.on('chat_deleted', handleChatDeleted)

// Cleanup
socket.off('chat_deleted', handleChatDeleted)
```

## Benefits of the Fixes

### 1. **Eliminated Timeouts**
- Reduced timeout from 30s to 10s
- Proper timeout clearing on success
- Better error handling

### 2. **Real-time Updates**
- Chat deletions are now broadcast to all connected clients
- Admin dashboard updates immediately
- Other admins see deletions in real-time

### 3. **Better User Experience**
- Faster feedback (10s vs 30s timeout)
- Clear success/error messages
- Proper loading states

### 4. **Improved Reliability**
- Socket events are properly handled
- Error handling prevents crashes
- Graceful degradation if socket fails

### 5. **Better Debugging**
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- Clear error messages
- Proper event tracking

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Start the server**: `npm run dev` in server directory
2. **Start the frontend**: `npm run dev` in drinkmate-main directory
3. **Open admin chat management**: Navigate to `/admin/chat-management`
4. **Delete a chat**: Click delete button on any chat
5. **Verify real-time updates**: Open another admin tab and verify the chat disappears immediately
6. **Check timeout behavior**: If there's an error, it should timeout after 10 seconds instead of 30

## Monitoring

The fixes include comprehensive logging:
- `ðŸ”¥ Chat deleted event received for chat {chatId}`
- `ðŸ”¥ Chat deleted event broadcasted for chat {chatId}`
- `ðŸ”¥ Chat deletion socket events emitted for chat {chatId}`
- `ðŸ”¥ Deletion timeout reached, clearing deleting state`

These logs help monitor the chat deletion flow and identify any issues.

## Future Improvements

1. **Add retry mechanism** for failed deletions
2. **Implement soft deletion** with restore functionality
3. **Add audit logging** for chat deletions
4. **Implement bulk deletion** with progress indicators
5. **Add confirmation dialogs** with more details about what will be deleted
