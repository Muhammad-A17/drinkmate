# Image Timeout Fix Documentation

## Problem
The application was experiencing image timeout errors with Cloudinary images:
```
тип upstream image response timed out for https://res.cloudinary.com/dw2h8hejn/image/upload/...
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Custom Image Loader (`lib/imageLoader.js`)
- Created a custom image loader that optimizes Cloudinary URLs
- Uses Cloudinary's transformation API for automatic format selection and quality optimization
- Includes retry logic with exponential backoff for failed image loads

### 2. ImageWithFallback Component (`components/ui/ImageWithFallback.tsx`)
- Custom React component that wraps Next.js Image component
- Implements fallback handling for failed image loads
- Shows loading spinner while images are loading
- Automatically retries failed images with custom timeout (10 seconds)
- Falls back to placeholder image if all retries fail

### 3. Next.js Configuration Updates (`next.config.mjs`)
- Added custom image loader configuration
- Increased device sizes and image sizes for better responsive images
- Maintained security settings while improving performance

### 4. Placeholder Image (`public/placeholder.svg`)
- Created a simple SVG placeholder for failed image loads
- Lightweight and scalable fallback image

## Usage

Replace standard Next.js Image components with ImageWithFallback:

```tsx
// Before
<Image
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/..."
  alt="Description"
  width={180}
  height={225}
  className="..."
/>

// After
<ImageWithFallback
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/..."
  alt="Description"
  width={180}
  height={225}
  className="..."
  priority={true}
  quality={85}
/>
```

## Benefits

1. **Timeout Handling**: Images now have a 10-second timeout instead of the default 3 seconds
2. **Retry Logic**: Failed images are automatically retried up to 3 times
3. **Fallback Images**: Graceful degradation with placeholder images
4. **Loading States**: Visual feedback during image loading
5. **Cloudinary Optimization**: Automatic format selection and quality optimization
6. **Better Performance**: Responsive image sizes and optimized loading

## Files Modified

- `next.config.mjs` - Added custom image loader configuration
- `lib/imageLoader.js` - Custom image loader with Cloudinary optimization
- `components/ui/ImageWithFallback.tsx` - Fallback image component
- `public/placeholder.svg` - Placeholder image
- `app/page.tsx` - Updated all Cloudinary images to use ImageWithFallback

## Testing

The solution has been applied to all Cloudinary images in the main page. The application should now:
- Load images without timeout errors
- Show loading spinners during image load
- Display placeholder images for failed loads
- Retry failed images automatically
