}

// After: Complete structure based on WSDL
'ns:Transaction': {
    'ns:Reference1': 'TrackShipment',
    'ns:Reference2': new Date().toISOString(),
    'ns:Reference3': '',
    'ns:Reference4': '',
    'ns:Reference5': ''
}
```

### Shipment Details Enhancement
```javascript
// Added comprehensive financial fields
'ns:CashOnDeliveryAmount': {
    'ns:Value': 0,
    'ns:CurrencyCode': 'SAR'
},
'ns:InsuranceAmount': {
    'ns:Value': 0,
    'ns:CurrencyCode': 'SAR'
},
// ... and more
```

### New Pickup Management
```javascript
// Complete pickup request structure
const pickupData = {
    address: { /* pickup address */ },
    contact: { /* pickup contact */ },
    pickupDate: '2024-01-01T10:00:00Z',
    readyTime: '10:00',
    lastPickupTime: '17:00',
    comments: 'Pickup instructions'
};
```
